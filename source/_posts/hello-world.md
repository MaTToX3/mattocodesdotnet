Haven't been doing any blogging for a while now. Some time ago I actually migrated my domain to the DigitalOcean cloud and was just too lazy to do the whole Wordpress set up and import the database. Seems so complicated when you did it 1000 times before. So, I was thinking, how to get rid of this thing, which I will most likely never have to do again - pretty smart huh?

## The answer - static page builder

I will just learn another framework ... So I went to do just that. Quick (duck)[https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=laravel+static+site+generator&ia=web] with query `laravel static site generator` and I had the top result: (Jigsaw)[https://jigsaw.tighten.co/]. Sounds scary enough.

Let's play a game!

## Why even use static pages

We used static pages in 90s right? Yeah ...

So, why are they cool again? Well, there are multiple reasons, some of them being:

- they are fast
- they are secure
- no special hosting needed

Of course, not everything is that great. For example, I am writing all the bosts using markdown syntax - however all my posts are static files which means I can push my work to the GitHub repo. That's not bad after all.

However, I don't think that this method is the way to-go for non-savy people; classic database-driven CMS are still the most easy and user-friendly systems to use.

But, since I consider myself a developer, I will just test this one out. And posibly switch to something else soon...

## Getting started with Jigsaw

Let's do a quick set up to see it in action.
