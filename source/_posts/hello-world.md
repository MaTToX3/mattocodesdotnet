Haven't been doing any blogging for a while now. Some time ago I actually migrated my domain to the DigitalOcean cloud and was just too lazy to do the whole Wordpress set up and import the database. Seems so complicated when you did it 1000 times before. So, I was thinking, how to get rid of this thing, which I will most likely never have to do again - pretty smart huh?

## The answer - static page builder

I will just learn another framework ... So I went to do just that. Quick (duck)[https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=laravel+static+site+generator&ia=web] with query `laravel static site generator` and I had the top result: (Jigsaw)[https://jigsaw.tighten.co/]. Sounds scary enough.

Let's play a game!
